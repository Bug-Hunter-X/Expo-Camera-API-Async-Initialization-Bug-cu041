This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API and trying to access the camera's features asynchronously.  The problem is that accessing camera properties like `camera.type` or `camera.flashMode` before the camera is fully initialized may result in undefined values or unexpected behavior. This is because the camera object itself is not yet properly populated when initially accessed.  The bug manifests as intermittent crashes, incorrect values being returned, or silent failures that are difficult to track down. For example, `camera.type` may return `undefined` leading to incorrect conditions in switch statements or conditional logic.
